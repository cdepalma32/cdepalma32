### Hi, I’m Crystal 🤍  
> Full-Stack Developer | Human-Centered Software | State, Auth & API Design


I build things that help people think, learn, and continuously level up.

I’m a full-stack developer focused on intuitive interfaces, clean backend architecture, and systems that *make sense* — not just work.

My work tends to merge:
- clarity of thought  
- aesthetic minimalism  
- guided systems that make complex learning feel calm, structured, and human

### What I’m Building Now

**IntPrepApp** — a mindful technical practice tool  
→ Pattern recognition, memory pacing, self-tracking, confidence building

**TaxBuddy AI** — human-tone financial clarity  
→ A conversational tax assistant powered by FastAPI + Azure SQL + GPT

Both are in active development.  
Both are about reducing overwhelm and **increasing trust in one’s own mind through clear, accessible frameworks.**
